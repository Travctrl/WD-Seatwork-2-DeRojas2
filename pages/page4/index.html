      <h2 class="title">The Future’s Edge: Miguel O’Hara</h2>
      <h4 class="subtitle">He’s not your friendly neighborhood anything.</h4>
      <div class="description">
        <p>In the neon-lit sprawl of Nueva York, where corporations rule and technology blurs the line between man and machine, one name strikes fear into the shadows — Miguel O’Hara, Spider-Man 2099. A brilliant geneticist turned reluctant vigilante, Miguel didn’t ask for this life. It was forced on him by betrayal, by circumstance — by science gone too far.</p>
      <p> He's not driven by guilt or tragedy. He’s driven by cold logic and the need to fix a future spiraling out of control.</p>
      <p>
        Wearing a suit made of unstable molecules and armed with talons, fangs, and a mind sharper than his claws, Miguel is a Spider-Man unlike any the world has seen. He doesn’t crack jokes. He doesn’t pull punches. And he doesn’t have time for mistakes.
      </p>
      <p>
Calculating, intense, and unflinchingly driven, Miguel walks the razor’s edge between hero and enforcer — a one-man resistance against a broken system. Where others hesitate, he acts. Where others fall, he climbs.
      </p>
      <p>
Because in a fractured multiverse, Miguel O’Hara isn’t just trying to survive.

He’s trying to make sure the future still has one.
      </p>
