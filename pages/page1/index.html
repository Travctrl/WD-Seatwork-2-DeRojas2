          <h3>Origin Story</h3>
          <p>
            Miles Morales is a teenage superhero who first appeared in Ultimate Fallout #4 (2011), created by writer Brian Michael Bendis and artist Sara Pichelli. He comes from an alternate Marvel universe known as Earth-1610 (the Ultimate Universe), where he is the second person to take on the Spider-Man mantle after the death of Peter Parker. Miles is a Brooklyn native of African-American and Puerto Rican descent, raised by his parents, Jefferson Davis and Rio Morales. His story begins when his uncle, Aaron Davis—secretly the villain known as the Prowler—steals a genetically altered spider from Oscorp. The spider eventually bites Miles, granting him powers similar to Peter Parker’s, such as wall-crawling, enhanced strength and agility, and a danger-sensing "spider-sense." However, Miles also develops unique abilities, including camouflage (invisibility) and a venom blast that delivers a bio-electric shock.

            At first, Miles is reluctant to embrace his powers or become a hero. But when Peter Parker dies saving the city, Miles is overcome with guilt for not stepping in sooner. Inspired by Peter’s bravery and sense of responsibility, he creates his own black-and-red Spider-Man suit and begins fighting crime in his honor. Over time, he gains the respect of other heroes and becomes a vital part of the superhero community. During the 2015 Secret Wars event, the Marvel multiverse collapses, and Miles—along with his family and supporting cast—is merged into the main Marvel Universe (Earth-616), where he continues to operate as Spider-Man alongside Peter Parker.

            Miles’ story is one of legacy, identity, and personal growth. He grapples with what it means to live up to the Spider-Man name while staying true to his roots. His background and experiences bring a fresh perspective to the superhero genre, making him one of Marvel’s most popular and influential modern characters. He has since appeared in various media, most notably the critically acclaimed animated films Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse and Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, as well as the hit video game Spider-Man: Miles Morales.
