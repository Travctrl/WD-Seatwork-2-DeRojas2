          <h3>Origin Story</h3>
          <p class="origin-story">
            Gwen Stacy was a normal teenager, a drummer in a band called The Mary Janes, when a genetically altered spider bit her, granting her superhuman abilities. These included wall-crawling, enhanced strength and agility, and a “spider-sense” that warns her of danger. Embracing the role of a superhero, Gwen becomes Spider-Woman and begins fighting crime in her city.
          </p>
            <p class="origin-story">
              Her story takes a dark turn when her best friend, Peter Parker, dies tragically. In this universe, Peter, desperate to become special like Spider-Woman, experiments on himself and becomes the Lizard. In a confrontation with Gwen, Peter dies, either from the transformation or the battle. The public wrongly blames Spider-Woman for Peter’s death, and she becomes a fugitive hunted by both the police and the media—including her own father, Captain George Stacy, who is a high-ranking police officer unaware of Gwen’s secret identity.

            </p>
<p class="origin-story">
  Eventually, Captain Stacy discovers the truth—that his daughter is Spider-Woman—and this revelation shifts the emotional weight of Gwen’s story. She’s not only fighting villains but also struggling with guilt, public distrust, and the pressure of living up to her own ideals. She continues her heroic journey while trying to protect the people she loves and find redemption in a world that sees her as a menace.
