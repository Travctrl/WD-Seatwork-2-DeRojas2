        <h3>The Jaded Hero</h3>
        <p>
Peter B. Parker is the older, more seasoned incarnation of Spider-Man — a man who has spent years wearing the mask and bearing the weight of great responsibility. Unlike the youthful, optimistic version of Spider-Man that many are familiar with, Peter B. carries the marks of a life filled with hard choices, personal losses, and relentless battles. His once-hopeful outlook has been tempered by experience, leaving him world-weary and sarcastic, with a slightly disheveled appearance and a dry sense of humor.
        </p>
        <p>
          He's been through it all — the triumphs of saving lives, the heartbreaks of losing loved ones, and the constant struggle to balance being a hero with trying to live a normal life. His marriage has crumbled, his body aches more than it used to, and the idealism that once drove him has faded. Yet, beneath the layers of cynicism and regret lies the heart of a true hero — one who still believes in doing what's right, even if it doesn't always come easily anymore.
        </p>
        <p>
          When Peter B. Parker meets Miles Morales, a young teenager thrust into the chaotic world of superheroes, he reluctantly takes on the role of mentor. At first, he’s doubtful — of himself, of Miles, of everything — but through their journey together, Peter begins to rediscover the spark that once made him believe in being Spider-Man. Guiding Miles not only helps the younger hero grow into his own identity, but it also reminds Peter that even when life gets messy and painful, hope is still worth holding onto.
        </p>
        <p>
          Peter B. Parker is a deeply human take on the superhero archetype — flawed, funny, and unexpectedly touching. His journey is one of redemption, rediscovery, and passing the torch to a new generation, proving that even a jaded hero can still make a difference.
